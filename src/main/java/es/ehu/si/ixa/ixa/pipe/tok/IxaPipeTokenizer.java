/**
 *  IxaPipeTokenizer is based on the {@link IxaPipeLexer} class. 
 *  This Tokenizer overrides {@link AbstractTokenizer} getToken() method 
 *  by using the {@link IxaPipeLexer} yylex() method.  
 *  
 * This Tokenizer tokenizes running text but also provides normalization functions 
 * to comply with annotation in corpora such as Penn Treebank for English and 
 * Ancora Corpus for Spanish. Most of the normalization rules have been adapted from 
 * the @link PTBLexer class of Stanford CoreNLP version 3.2.0, but with many changes for 
 * other requirements, such as those of the Ancora corpus. 
 *  
 * Specifically, apart from English Penn Treebank-compliant tokenization, 
 * this Tokenizer provides:
 *  
 * <ol>
 *  <li> multilingual treatment of apostrophes for Catalan, French and Italian styles 
 *       (l' aquila, c' est, etc.) possibly applying to other languages with the same 
 *       rules for splitting apostrophes. 
 *  <li> multilingual support for non-breaking prefixes, adding language-specific 
 *       acronyms and person titles, etc., for Dutch, German, French, Italian and Spanish. 
 *  <li> normalization for Ancora corpus in Spanish.
 *  <li> paragraph tokenization to provide paragraph information.
 *  </ol> 
 *      
 * By default, the tokenizer does PTB3 normalization style except brackets and forward 
 * slashes (value "default" of ixa-pipe-tok -normalization parameter as described below). 
 * To change these options, the ixa-pipe-tok CLI currently provides four options, accessible via the 
 * "-normalization" parameter. 
 * 
 * <ol>
 *   <li>sptb3: Strict Penn Treebank normalization. Performs all normalizations listed below 
 *       except tokenizeNLs. 
 *   <li>ptb3: Activates all SPTB3 normalizations except: 
 *     <ol>
 *       <li>Acronym followed by a boundaryToken, the boundaryToken in this option
 *           is duplicated: "S.A." -> "S.A. .", whereas sptb3 does "S.A ." (only exception
 *           in sptb3 is "U.S." for which the last dot is duplicated. 
 *       <li> This option returns fractions such as "2 3/4" as a Token object, 
 *          but sptb3 separate them into two Token objects. 
 *     </ol>
 *   <li> default: ptb3 minus (all types of) brackets and escapeForwardSlash normalizations.
 *   <li> ancora: Ancora corpus based normalization. Like default, except that every 
 *        quote is normalized into ascii quotes. 
 * </ol> 
 * 
 * The normalization performed by the four options above are (in the order in which
 * they appear in the @link JFlexLexer specification):
 * <ol> 
 * <li>tokenizeParagraphs: creates Paragraph Tokens when more than newlines are found.
 *       Paragraphs are denoted by "*<P>*"
 *   <li>tokenizeNLs: create Token objects with newline characters
 *   <li>escapeForwardSlash: escape / and * -> \/ \*
 *   <li>normalizeBrackets: Normalize ( and ) into -LRB- and -RRB- respectively
 *   <li>normalizeOtherBrackets: Normalize {} and[] into -LCB-, -LRB- and -RCB-, -RRB-
 *   <li>latexQuotes: Normalize to ``, `, ', '' for every quote (discouraged by Unicode).
 *   <li>unicodeQuotes: Normalize quotes to the range U+2018-U+201D,
 *       following Unicode recommendation.
 *   <li>asciiQuotes: Normalize quote characters to ascii ' and ". The quotes preference 
 *       default order is latex -> Unicode -> ascii
 *   <li>sptb3Normalize: normalize fractions and Acronyms as described by the sptb3 option above. 
 *   <li>ptb3Dashes: Normalize various dash characters into "--",
 *   <li>normalizeAmpersand: Normalize the XML &amp;amp; into an ampersand
 *   <li>normalizeSpace: Turn every spaces in tokens (phone numbers, fractions
 *     get turned into non-breaking spaces (U+00A0).
 *   <li>normalizeFractions: Normalize fraction characters to forms like "1/2"   
 *   <li>normalizeCurrency: Currency mappings into $, #, or "cents", reflecting
 *     the fact that nothing else appears in the PTB3 WSJ (not Euro).
 *   <li>ptb3Ldots: Normalize ellipses into ...
 *   <li>unicodeLdots: Normalize dot and optional space sequences into the Unicode 
 *       ellipsis character (U+2026). Dots order of application is ptb3Ldots -> UnicodeLdots.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * For more CLI options, please check {@link CLI} javadoc and README file.
