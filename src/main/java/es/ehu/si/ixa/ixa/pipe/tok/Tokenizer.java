/**
 * Tokenizers break up text into individual Objects. The decisions to specify
 * this interface are pragmatically based on the main Tokenizer implementation
 * provided by ixa-pipe-tok, namely, the @link IxaPipeTokenizer. That
 * implementation uses JFlex to create a scanner which recognizes certain
 * patterns in running text and creates @link Token objects. The default API of {@link
 * IxaPipeLexer} provides a <code>yylex()</code> method that behaves roughly like a
 * <code>next()</code> Iterator function.
 * 
 * Thus, Tokenizer implementations will probably implement and/or override the
 * <code>next()</code> function. For example @link IxaPipeTokenizer provides
 * an implementation of
 * <code>next()<code> that uses internally the <code>yylex()</code> function of @link
 * IxaPipeLexer to obtain the Token objects. Other implementations, e.g., a 
 * @link WhiteSpaceTokenizer, are also expected to implement the <code>next()</code> function.
 * 
 * The same reason (JFlex API) dictates that implementations of this interface
 * are expected to have a constructor takes a Reader as argument.
 * 
 * A Tokenizer extends the Iterator interface, but it also provides a lookahead
 * operation <code>lookAhead()</code>.
